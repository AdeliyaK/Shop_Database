# Shop_Database
##Task 1: Entity-Relationship Model and Relational Database Design

###Objective: Develop a model and schema for a flower shop chain's database, as described in Appendix 1.

####Execution of the task involves:
#####a. Creating an entity-relationship (ER) model of the subject area.
#####b. Transforming the ER model into a set of tables, defining attributes and keys for each table.
#####c. Identifying additional data constraints imposed by the nature of the subject area.

####Task 2: DDL Queries for SQL Implementation of the Designed Schema

#####Compose a set of Data Definition Language (DDL) queries in SQL to implement the relational database schema designed in Task 1.

####Task 3: DML Queries for SQL with the Following Reports:

    Report on inventory status at a specific date in a given store.
    Report on sales made during a specific time period.
    Report on deliveries made to a specific address during a certain time period.
    Report on profit realized from typical items in the inventory during a specific time period.
    Report on profit realized from atypical items in the inventory during a specific time period.

Note: While creating the model, it is desirable for the executor to reflect, to the extent possible, the actual informational processes in the real subject area.

####Appendix 1 - Subject Area: Flower Shops

The database should contain information necessary for serving a chain of flower shops with the following characteristics:

    The company operates multiple stores where goods are delivered and sales are conducted.
    The company trades in various categories of flowers (stems, potted plants, bulbs, etc.) and types of sales (individual items, bouquets, bulk orders).
    The company processes pre-orders, including options from its regular inventory and those not typically dealt with.
    The company conducts sales from its stores and delivers to addresses.
